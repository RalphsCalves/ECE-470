# ========== QUESTION: ==========
# We want a robot to move from one location to another location in a straight line with time T = 5. 
# Let's parameterize the path as follows: 
# s = a_0 + a_1(t) + a_2(t^2) + a_3(t^3)
# where time t belongs to [0,T]. 


# ====== Enter INPUT HERE =======
NO INPUTS NO CODE

# =========== ANSWER ============
# We need the robot to start with zero velocity, and reach the destination with zero velocity. Find a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3.

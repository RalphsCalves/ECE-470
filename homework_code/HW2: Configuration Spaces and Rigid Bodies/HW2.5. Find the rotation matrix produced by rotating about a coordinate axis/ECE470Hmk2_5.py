# ========== QUESTION: ==========
# Suppose that frame 1 and frame 0 are initially aligned, and that frame 1 rotates by an angle theta about the z_0 axis.

# ====== Enter INPUT HERE =======
theta = 0.76 # about z_0 axis

theta = -1.51 # about x_0 axis

# =========== ANSWER ============
# Compute R_01:
# R_01 = [[0.724836010741, -0.688921445111, 0], [0.688921445111, 0.724836010741, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

# Compute R_01
# R_01 = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0.0607588812194, 0.998152472498], [0, -0.998152472498, 0.0607588812194]]

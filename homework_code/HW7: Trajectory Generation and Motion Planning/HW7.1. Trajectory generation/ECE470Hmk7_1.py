# ========== QUESTION: ==========
# As shown in the figure above, consider an elliptical path in the  plane. 
# The path starts at origin and proceeds clockwise to , , , and back to origin. 


# ====== Enter INPUT HERE =======
x = 2.00000000
y = 3.00000000
s = 0.91000000

# =========== ANSWER ============
# First write the path as a function of path parameter  then find the xy-coordinate of a point x_1, y_1ã€€on this path if s = .91.

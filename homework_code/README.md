# **Welcome to UIUC ECE 470: Intro to Robotics**

In this folder holds all of the code that I built in order to do the PrairieLearn Coding Assignments. I personnally had a hard time working with Python (even as a CompE major), so I would like to "help" someone else with coding linear algebra on Python

# PL Homework 1:
Easy, no coding required

# PL Homework 2:
Feel free to take a look at the code, the variables for each question are different

# PL Homework 3: Forward Kinematics
The code for each of these problem work. Seeing that each of the orientations and positions of each of the robots are different, it will be your job to find out how to use the code to find the Forward Kinematics:

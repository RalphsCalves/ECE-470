# ========== QUESTION: ==========
# The schematic of a robot with 6 joints (in the zero position) is shown above. 
# Frame 0 is fixed to the base. Frame 1 is fixed to the tool. 

# ====== Enter INPUT HERE =======
T_1in0 = np.array([[-0.45174805, -0.17916214, -0.87397061, 0.60710123], 
                   [0.42990787, -0.90210250, -0.03728664, 4.05579210], 
                   [-0.78173072, -0.39257101, 0.48454626, -3.77935434],

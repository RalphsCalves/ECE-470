# ========== QUESTION: ==========
# The schematic of a robot with 3 joints (in the zero position) is shown above. 
# Frame 0 is fixed to the base. Frame 1 is fixed to the tool. 
# For the given values of the joint variables theta

# ====== Enter INPUT HERE =======
theta = np.array([[-0.74], [0.83], [0.71]])

# =========== ANSWER ============
# find the matrix (J) for which the body twist of frame 1 can be expressed as
# This matrix is called the "body Jacobian" of the robot.


# ============ CODE =============

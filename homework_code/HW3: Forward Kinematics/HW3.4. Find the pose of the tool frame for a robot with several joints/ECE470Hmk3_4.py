# ========== QUESTION: ==========
# The schematic of a robot with 5 joints (in the zero position) is shown above. 
# Frame 0 is fixed to the base. Frame 1 is fixed to the tool. 
# Denote the joint variables together by theta. 

# ====== Enter INPUT HERE =======
theta = np.array([[-0.47, 0.09, 0.46, 0.57, -0.52]])

# =========== ANSWER ============
# Find the pose  of frame 1 when the joint variables take the given values.
